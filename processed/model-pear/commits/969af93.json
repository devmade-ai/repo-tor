  "body": "Replace numerical math tests with readable workflow-based tests that verify\ndisplayed values are logically correct based on user actions and inputs.\n\nChanges:\n- Create ASSERTIONS library with reusable logical checks\n- Each assertion has: field name, readable logic formula, description\n- Define WORKFLOW_SCENARIOS that read like user stories\n- Tests now verify \"Developer Revenue = Cost × (1 + Markup)\" logic\n- Not testing math (1000 × 1.1 = 1100), testing business logic\n- Update UI to display stories, workflow badges, and assertion formulas",
