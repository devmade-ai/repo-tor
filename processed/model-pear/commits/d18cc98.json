  "subject": "Fix budget calculations to handle large budgets and improve capacity detection",
  "body": "- Add findCapacityInput() helper with case-insensitive keyword matching\n- Add calculateCapacityLimit() to dynamically scale search limits based on budget\n- Update findMaximumCapacity() to support budgets up to 1M capacity\n- Update findBestValue() with adaptive step sizes and dynamic limits (up to 50k)\n- Update findConservativeOption() with dynamic limits (up to 25k)\n- Fix issue where 10M budget showed \"no options\" due to hardcoded 10k limit\n\nThis resolves the budget calculation issue where large budgets were constrained\nby hardcoded capacity limits that were too low.",
