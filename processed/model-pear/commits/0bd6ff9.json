  "subject": "feat: implement Negotiation Mode UI changes",
  "body": "Based on Discovery Framework findings, implement \"Simplified by Default\" approach\nfor client-facing negotiation sessions.\n\nInput Field Enhancements:\n- Add benchmark property for industry standard badges (e.g., \"Industry: 5-15%\")\n- Add essential property to control field grouping\n- InputField displays benchmark badges next to labels\n\nCalculator Page Refactor:\n- Progressive disclosure: Essential inputs visible, Advanced collapsed\n- Sensitivity/Projections moved to collapsible \"Advanced Analysis\" section\n- Transfer Pricing collapsed by default (shows risk badge)\n- One-click save with auto-generated names\n- Saved options count shown in action bar\n\nThis aligns with the 5 design principles from discovery:\n1. Client in the room - cleaner, less overwhelming UI\n2. Neutral ground first - industry benchmarks prominently displayed\n3. Show both sides - Developer/Buyer results always visible\n4. Progressive complexity - advanced features tucked away\n5. Compare to decide - prominent save, easy comparison flow",
