  "body": "Extracted a shared NAMING_CONVENTIONS block appended to both JSON and\nMarkdown convention content. The rules are prescriptive enough that two\nindependent AI sessions given the same real-world data should produce\nidentical titles, labels, arc titles, and property keys — enabling\nreliable duplicate detection by the merge service.\n\nKey additions:\n- Title rules: most widely recognized name, no legal suffixes, no\n  honorifics, no abbreviations unless the acronym IS the common name\n- Label rules: singular PascalCase, standard vocabulary of 19 common\n  labels, broad-over-narrow preference\n- Arc title rules: lowercase verb phrases, active voice, present/past\n  tense distinction, standard vocabulary of 26 common relationships\n- Property rules: camelCase keys, standard vocabulary, typed values\n  (real numbers, booleans, ISO dates, arrays instead of CSV strings)\n- Deduplication guidance: reuse IDs for same entity, merge aliases,\n  no duplicate arcs\n\nTags: conventions, naming, consistency, import, merge\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: conventions\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01TqYv4V9ccQCb5F6ZhnubYn",
