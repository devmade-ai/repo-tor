  "subject": "fix(import): handle multiple existing nodes with same title in merge",
  "body": "The merge service used Map<string, GraphNode> for title-based matching,\nwhich silently dropped all but the last existing node when multiple shared\na title (e.g., \"Apple\" [Company] vs \"Apple\" [Fruit]). Imported \"Apple\"\nwould match whichever was stored last, ignoring labels entirely.\n\nNow uses Map<string, GraphNode[]> and ranks candidates by label overlap:\nexact label match first, then most shared labels, then first candidate\nas fallback. Each imported node independently picks its best match.\n\nTags: import, merge, deduplication\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 3\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: medium\nDebt: paid\nEpic: import-compatibility\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01GmBxqTbwGYpy2GUF4TGDLk",
