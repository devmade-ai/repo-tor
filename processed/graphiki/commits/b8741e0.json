  "subject": "feat(query): add interactive query builder with relationship predicates and pipeline",
  "body": "Replace plain-text QueryBar with interactive QueryBuilder that supports visual\nfilter rows, pipeline chaining, and an advanced text mode. Extend the query\nengine with relationship predicates (IN/OUT/CONN for arc-aware node filtering),\ncomparison operators (<, >, <=, >= with date/number/string auto-detection), and\na pipeline executor where each step narrows results while preserving full graph\ncontext for relationship evaluation.\n\nNew files:\n- QueryBuilder.tsx: Visual builder with filter rows, pipeline steps, dual mode\n- QueryFilterRow.tsx: Individual filter row (label, property, title, relationship)\n- QueryBuilder.css: Dark theme styles for builder components\n- useGraphMetadata.ts: Hook extracting distinct labels/keys/values for autocomplete\n- docs/working/interactive-query-builder.md: Architecture and design plan\n\nKey design decisions:\n- Builder produces AST directly via builderFilterToAST/builderStepToAST,\n  bypassing text parsing for reliable structured query construction\n- Pipeline executor uses full graph context (all arcs/nodes) for relationship\n  predicates even when candidate nodes have been narrowed by prior steps\n- Case-insensitive property key lookup in evaluator to handle parser lowercasing\n  vs camelCase data model keys\n\nTags: query-builder, pipeline, relationship-predicates, interactive-ui\nComplexity: 4\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: medium\nDebt: neutral\nEpic: interactive-query-builder\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_014Wiyxz1YhpqftgctiarRyv",
