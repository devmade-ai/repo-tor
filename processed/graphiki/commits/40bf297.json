  "subject": "docs(all): update documentation to reflect current architecture",
  "body": "README was a placeholder with just \"# graphiki\". Now includes project\noverview, features, tech stack, getting started, project structure,\ndata model, configuration, and license.\n\nDiscovery doc had stale references to tab-based navigation, split-panel\nlayout, editable conventions page, ConventionRules interface, and\nAppState type — all artifacts of the pre-realignment architecture.\nUpdated to reflect single-view layout with drawer overlay, read-only\nconventions modal, and removed obsolete type definitions.\n\nCLAUDE.md docs tree was missing markdown-import-format.md and\nai-research-output-guide.md. Also listed historical working docs.\nFixed JSON export version reference from \"1\" to \"2\".\n\nMarkdown import format doc referenced schema-based type resolution.\nUpdated to reflect label-based system where tags/type/labels frontmatter\nfields all become labels.\n\nAdded SUPERSEDED/COMPLETED status banners to all 6 historical working\ndocs (phase-2 through phase-6, mode-differentiation-alignment).\n\nTags: docs, readme, discovery, conventions, architecture\nComplexity: 3\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: internal\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: documentation\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01GNAcWQsJLvaecBNw4ya2Xa",
