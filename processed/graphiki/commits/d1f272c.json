  "subject": "fix(ui): resolve 7 UX/UI issues found during review",
  "body": "1. Node labels unreadable: Changed Cytoscape node label color from\n   #1f2937 (near-black) to #e2e8f0 (light gray) so text is readable\n   on the dark #0f172a canvas background.\n\n2. btn-small class mismatch: DetailPanel used \"btn-small\" but CSS only\n   defines \"btn-sm\". Renamed to btn-sm so property editor buttons\n   (+ Add, ×) render with correct compact sizing.\n\n3. Dead CSV CSS removed: Deleted ~110 lines of unused .import-csv-*\n   and .csv-mapper-* styles left over from CSV import removal during\n   Product Realignment.\n\n4. Mobile menu touch-close: Added touchstart listener alongside\n   mousedown so the hamburger dropdown closes when tapping outside\n   on touch-only mobile devices.\n\n5. Context menu off-screen: Added viewport bounds checking via ref\n   callback that adjusts left/top when the menu would overflow the\n   right or bottom viewport edge.\n\n6. Arc creation UI: Added ConnectNodeModal with searchable node picker\n   and optional relationship name. Accessible via \"Connect to...\" in\n   the right-click/long-press context menu. Creates directed arc from\n   source to selected target. Updated tutorial step 2 to reference\n   the new connection flow.\n\n7. Stale comment: Fixed App.tsx comment that still referenced\n   \"Upload/Query/Graph/Conventions\" tabs (only Graph/Conventions exist).\n\nTags: ui, ux, accessibility, arc-creation, cleanup\nComplexity: 3\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: medium\nDebt: paid\nEpic: polish\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_016xsjTMjavoQa1P26ivfZ6A",
