  "subject": "fix(import): rename JSON format \"arcs\" to \"connections\", add property type coercion",
  "body": "Three user-facing fixes:\n\n1. JSON export/import format uses \"connections\" instead of \"arcs\" — matches\n   the terminology used everywhere else in the UI and documentation.\n\n2. Property type coercion on save — numbers, booleans, and JSON arrays/objects\n   typed into text inputs are preserved as their correct types instead of being\n   stored as strings. Critical for boolean logic, calculations, and timeline\n   date-based sorting.\n\n3. Terminology cleanup: \"Select a node or arc\" → \"Select an item\",\n   \"Untitled Arc\" → \"Untitled Connection\".\n\nAlso removes CSV from the AI research output guide since CSV import was never\nwired up and markdown/JSON cover all use cases (CSV can't express connections).\n\nTags: import, json, types, ui, guide\nComplexity: 3\nUrgency: 3\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: import-compatibility\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01GmBxqTbwGYpy2GUF4TGDLk",
