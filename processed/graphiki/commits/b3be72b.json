  "body": "Implements six graph algorithms as pure functions on adjacency lists,\nwith a collapsible UI panel for running them and visual overlays on\nthe graph canvas for displaying results.\n\nAlgorithms implemented:\n- Degree centrality: identifies hub nodes by connection count\n- Betweenness centrality (Brandes): finds bridge nodes between clusters\n- PageRank (power iteration): ranks nodes by network influence\n- Connected components (BFS): partitions graph into disconnected groups\n- Shortest path (BFS): finds shortest route between two selected nodes\n- Clustering coefficient: measures local triangle density\n\nVisualization:\n- Score-based node sizing (30-70px scaled by normalized score)\n- Path highlighting with accent color on nodes and arcs\n- Component coloring with 10-color palette\n- Non-highlighted elements dimmed to 20% opacity\n- Cytoscape class-based styling (analysis-dimmed, analysis-highlighted)\n\nUI:\n- AnalysisPanel with algorithm dropdown, description, source/target pickers\n- Top-20 results table sorted by score\n- Path display with arrow notation\n- Component count summary\n- Collapsible panel (visible only in graph view)\n\nAlso removes stale reference to nonexistent docs/EXTRACTION_PLAYBOOK.md.\n\nTest coverage: 103 total (29 new analysis tests covering all algorithms\nwith star/chain/triangle/disconnected graph fixtures).\n\nTags: phase-5, analysis, algorithms, centrality, pagerank, pathfinding\nComplexity: 4\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: neutral\nEpic: analysis-algorithms\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_018HMdQnMHEiZkN2JkoXuu9E",
