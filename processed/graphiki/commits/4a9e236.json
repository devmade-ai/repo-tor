  "body": "Bug fixes:\n- JSON import now uses bulkPut (upsert) instead of add, preventing\n  ConstraintError on duplicate IDs when re-importing the same file.\n  Added bulkUpsertNodes/Arcs/Schemas to service layer.\n- queryResultCount derived from inline queryResult instead of computed\n  separately in handleRunQuery callback. Previous approach could show\n  a count that didn't match the actually-rendered filtered data when\n  nodes/arcs changed between callback run and next render.\n- Betweenness centrality normalization corrected from (n-1)*(n-2) to\n  (n-1)*(n-2)/2 for undirected graphs. Previous normalization produced\n  values 2x too high because each pair is traversed from both directions.\n\nCleanups:\n- Merged duplicate .modal-list-item CSS rule into single declaration.\n- Removed unused `arcs` prop from KanbanView, TableView, ViewContainer.\n\nTests:\n- Added 6 tests for autoSuggestMappings (title/name/label mapping,\n  tags/labels/categories, ID skipping, schema property matching,\n  fallback to lowercase, empty headers).\n\n109 tests passing, lint clean, build clean.\n\nTags: review, bugfix, cleanup, tests, phase-1-6\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 3\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: quality-review\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_018HMdQnMHEiZkN2JkoXuu9E",
