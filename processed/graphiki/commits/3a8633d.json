  "subject": "feat(import): auto-create unknown types during import",
  "body": "Adds typeResolutionService that post-processes import results to auto-create\nmissing node types, arc types, and infer property definitions. Runs as pure\nfunctions between parsing and persistence, preserving existing function purity.\n\nMarkdown import: `type: Person` in frontmatter now auto-creates a \"Person\"\nNodeType if it doesn't exist. Arc labels (\"contains\", \"links to\") become\nArcTypes. Frontmatter keys (role, department, etc.) are inferred as string\nPropertyDefinitions on auto-created types.\n\nJSON import: Optional `typeName` field on nodes/arcs enables name-based type\nresolution (extracted as hints in ImportResult, keeping GraphNode clean).\nValid typeId takes precedence over typeName.\n\nWhen no schema is active, a new schema is created (named after the import\nfile) and set as active. Undo import restores the previous active schema.\n\nImportModal shows informational banner about auto-created types in the\nvisual preview step before the user approves.\n\nTags: import, types, schema, auto-creation, type-resolution\nComplexity: 4\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: medium\nDebt: neutral\nEpic: markdown-import\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01DVdJxFenUrMeuYYuHvXis6",
