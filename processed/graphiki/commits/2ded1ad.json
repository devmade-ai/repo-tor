  "subject": "docs(guide): update AI output guide with import matching behavior",
  "body": "The naming conventions section incorrectly stated \"there is no\ndeduplication at all\" across imports, which contradicts the merge\nservice behavior. Updated to accurately describe how title matching,\ntag disambiguation, and duplicate/conflict detection work.\n\nKey changes:\n- Replaced incorrect \"no deduplication\" claim with actual behavior\n- Added \"How import matching works\" section explaining the 4-step\n  matching process (title match → tag disambiguation → dup/conflict → new)\n- Added rule 7: always include tags for ambiguous titles\n- Promoted tags from optional to recommended in both Markdown and JSON\n  tips sections, explaining their role in re-import matching\n\nTags: docs, import, guide, conventions\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 3\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: import-compatibility\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01GmBxqTbwGYpy2GUF4TGDLk",
