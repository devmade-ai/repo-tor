  "subject": "feat(import): add arc deduplication to merge service",
  "body": "Previously, arcs were blindly accepted on every import — re-importing\nthe same data created duplicate connections every time. Now arcs go\nthrough the same new/duplicate/conflict detection as nodes.\n\nArc matching: after node matching builds an ID remap (imported → existing),\narc endpoints are remapped and compared against existing arcs by\nsource+target+normalized title. Direction matters; reversed endpoints\nare treated as distinct.\n\nChanges:\n- mergeService: MergeArcItem now has existingMatch, status, propertyDiffs.\n  buildMergeProposal accepts existingArcs parameter. getApprovedItems\n  preserves existing arc ID for accepted conflicts.\n- countByStatus returns nested { nodes, arcs } counts.\n- ImportModal: accepts and passes existingArcs prop.\n- App.tsx: passes arcs to ImportModal.\n- MergeReview: shows connection sections (new/duplicate/conflict) with\n  human-readable \"Source → Target (relationship)\" labels, per-item\n  toggle, and bulk accept/skip.\n\nTags: import, merge, arcs, deduplication\nComplexity: 3\nUrgency: 3\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: medium\nDebt: paid\nEpic: import-compatibility\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01GmBxqTbwGYpy2GUF4TGDLk",
