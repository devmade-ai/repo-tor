  "subject": "feat(workspaces): add multiple workspace support with full isolation",
  "body": "Add complete workspace system allowing users to create, manage, and\nswitch between independent knowledge graphs. Each workspace has its\nown nodes, arcs, and views with no cross-workspace references.\n\nKey changes:\n- Workspace type and workspaceId field on all entities (nodes, arcs, views)\n- Database v5 migration: workspaces table, workspaceId indexes, existing\n  data migrated to Default workspace (ws-default)\n- workspaceService: CRUD with events, cascading delete (removes all\n  workspace nodes/arcs/views in a single transaction)\n- WorkspaceManager: landing page with grid of workspace cards, inline\n  create/rename, delete confirmation\n- Demo data seeded into separate \"Demo\" workspace (ws-demo)\n- All services and hooks scoped by workspaceId\n- Import/export stamps workspaceId on imported data\n- Snapshot service scoped to workspace for undo-after-import\n- All 316 tests pass, lint clean, build succeeds\n\nTags: workspaces, multi-graph, data-model, services, components, hooks, database\nComplexity: 5\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: high\nDebt: neutral\nEpic: multiple-workspaces\nSemver: major\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_011D9ZTMQs9N9LGrFDTnWdDD",
