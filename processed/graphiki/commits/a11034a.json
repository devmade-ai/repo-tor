  "body": "Tutorial Step 2: Removed false claim that long-press connects items.\nThe context menu only has Edit/Duplicate/Delete — there is no UI for\nmanually creating arcs between existing nodes. Reworded to \"Create and\nExplore\" focusing on what actually works (selecting, viewing details).\n\nAppTab type: Removed dead 'upload' and 'query' values from the union.\nThese tabs were planned in the Product Realignment Phase 2 but never\nbuilt — import and query were integrated into the Graph tab instead\n(import via modals, query bar inline). Updated useAppMode to stop\naccepting stale values, and updated tests to match.\n\nArc count: Corrected \"~50 arcs\" to \"44 arcs\" in CLAUDE.md and\ndiscovery doc to match actual demoArcs array length.\n\nTags: docs, types, cleanup, accuracy\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: documentation\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_016xsjTMjavoQa1P26ivfZ6A",
