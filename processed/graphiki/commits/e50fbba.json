  "subject": "feat(import): add title-based fallback and field aliases for JSON connections",
  "body": "JSON import now resolves arc endpoints by title when sourceId/targetId\ndon't match any node ID. AI models frequently put titles in ID fields\nbecause the ID indirection is unintuitive for generated output.\n\nAlso accepts `source`/`target` as aliases for `sourceId`/`targetId`,\nmatching the same defensive pattern as the Markdown `to:`/`target:` fix.\n\nGuide updated: JSON tips now mention title-as-ID option and Unicode note.\n\nTags: import, json, connections, ai-output\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 3\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: ai-research-output\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_0166oa9msWRq48KCJ6pyca4J",
