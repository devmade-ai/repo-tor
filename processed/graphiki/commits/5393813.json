  "subject": "fix(ui): detail drawer opens on click, timeline dots aligned on line",
  "body": "Two bugs fixed:\n\n1. Detail drawer never opened when clicking a node or arc. Root cause:\n   cy.on('tap', handleTapBackground) fires on ALL taps, including\n   bubbled events from nodes and edges. The background handler cleared\n   the selection immediately after the node handler set it. Fix: check\n   evt.target === cy before clearing selection.\n\n2. Timeline marker dots were positioned ~15px to the right of the\n   vertical track line. Root cause: negative margin math was incorrect\n   under box-sizing: border-box (margin-left: -22px produced a dot\n   center at 24px, but the line center is at 9px). Fix: switch to\n   absolute positioning (left: -25px) for precise geometric alignment.\n\nTags: ui, graph-canvas, timeline, event-handling, css\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 4\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: polish\nSemver: patch",
