  "body": "Remove tab navigation (Graph/Conventions tabs). Graph is now always\nvisible as the primary view. Conventions and Analysis moved from\ninline panels/tabs to modals accessible via the burger menu.\n\nDetail panel replaced with an overlay DetailDrawer component:\n- Mobile: bottom sheet sliding up with drag handle and backdrop\n- Desktop: side panel sliding in from right with close button\n- Uses CSS transforms for GPU-accelerated animation instead of\n  width/height transitions that caused layout reflow\n\nPrevious SplitPanel push-layout was too subtle — users reported\nnot seeing any detail view when clicking nodes/arcs.\n\nTags: ui, layout, drawer, modal, conventions, analysis\nComplexity: 3\nUrgency: 3\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: medium\nDebt: paid\nEpic: ui-refinement\nSemver: minor",
