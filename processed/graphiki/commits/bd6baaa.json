  "subject": "docs(guide): add connection labels and properties guidance",
  "body": "The guide listed labels and properties as required connection fields\nbut gave no guidance on when to use them. AI assistants defaulted to\nempty arrays/objects with no understanding of what could go there.\n\nAdds \"Connection labels and properties\" subsection under Connection\nnaming with:\n- Three-field breakdown (title, labels, properties) mirroring item\n  guidance but adapted for relationship semantics\n- \"When to use\" tables for labels and properties with concrete examples\n- Rule of thumb for deciding whether data belongs on the connection\n  or on one of its endpoint items\n- Note that connection labels/properties are JSON-only (Markdown\n  auto-generates connections without metadata)\n\nTags: docs, ai-guide, import, connections\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: fix-import-compatibility\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01GmBxqTbwGYpy2GUF4TGDLk",
