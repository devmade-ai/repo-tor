  "subject": "refactor(conventions): remove deduplication section, keep alias rule",
  "body": "The DEDUPLICATION section conflated two concerns: cross-import dedup\n(handled by mergeService, not controllable by the AI generating the\nfile) and within-file dedup (basic AI competence, not worth spelling\nout). Removed the section entirely. The one non-obvious case — alias\nmerging when source data uses multiple names for the same entity —\nis now a bullet under TITLES where it logically belongs.\n\nTags: conventions, naming, cleanup\nComplexity: 1\nUrgency: 1\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: conventions\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01TqYv4V9ccQCb5F6ZhnubYn",
