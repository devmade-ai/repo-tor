  "body": "Exercise the query engine (executeQuery + executePipeline) against the\nfull demoData fixture (~40 nodes, ~44 arcs) to catch issues that small\nhandcrafted fixtures miss. Covers label/property/title filters, boolean\nlogic (AND/OR/NOT), parenthetical grouping, comparison operators,\nrelationship predicates (IN/OUT/CONN), compound queries, and multi-step\npipelines.\n\nSurfaced a known limitation: text parser cannot query labels containing\nspaces (e.g. \"competes with\") — documented in test comments.\n\nTags: query, testing, integration, demo-data\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 1\nImpact: internal\nRisk: low\nDebt: neutral\nEpic: interactive-query-builder\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_014Wiyxz1YhpqftgctiarRyv",
