  "subject": "refactor(conventions): consolidate AI import guide into single source of truth",
  "body": "Previously, AI import formatting guidance existed in two places:\nsrc/data/conventions.ts (displayed in-app) and\ndocs/ai-research-output-guide.md (standalone doc). Both served the\nsame audience (AI assistants) for the same purpose (formatting import\ndata) but had divergent content — the guide contained title vs tags\nvs properties decision rules, item heuristics, connection guidance,\nand import matching explanations that the conventions text lacked.\n\nMerged all guide content into conventions.ts as shared constants\n(FIELD_GUIDANCE, ITEM_GUIDANCE, CONNECTION_GUIDANCE, IMPORT_MATCHING)\ncomposed into each format's content. Both JSON and Markdown documents\nare now identical except for the format-specific section. Deleted the\nduplicate guide file. Updated CLAUDE.md references.\n\nTags: conventions, import, documentation, single-source-of-truth\nComplexity: 3\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: conventions\nSemver: minor\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_018xmmk3wFrVweq9EJkNXLFo",
