  "subject": "docs(guide): expand vocabulary and add cross-domain guidance",
  "body": "Expand the standard label vocabulary with 6 cross-domain additions\n(Theory, Law, Process, Movement, Artwork, Era) so AIs researching\nnon-business topics have anchors to standardize against instead of\ninventing labels from scratch.\n\nExpand connection title vocabulary with 9 cross-domain verbs\n(caused, led to, influenced, opposes, supports, discovered,\nreferences, governs, studied) covering causal, analytical,\nscientific, and comparative relationships.\n\nExpand property key vocabulary with 6 additions (medium, era,\njurisdiction, field, methodology, outcome) for arts, legal,\nand scientific domains.\n\nAdd \"Applying to other domains\" section with a table showing how\nthe format maps to science, history, arts, law, and philosophy.\n\nAdd source attribution guidance to both Markdown and JSON tips\n(use `source` property for primary references, inline citations\nin body text).\n\nAdd \"What deserves its own item\" heuristic so AIs can decide\nwhen to create a heading vs keep something as body text or a\nproperty.\n\nTags: docs, guide, conventions, vocabulary, cross-domain\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: output-guide\nSemver: patch",
