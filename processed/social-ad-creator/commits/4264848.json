  "subject": "Revert per-group alignment to cell-level alignment",
  "body": "Per-group alignment caused text elements to overlap because each group\nwas rendered in its own absolutely positioned container. This change\nreverts to cell-level alignment where all text groups in a cell share\na single alignment container, allowing text to flow naturally.\n\n- Simplified textGroups state to only store cell assignment (no alignment)\n- Removed per-group alignment controls from Placement tab\n- Updated AdCanvas to render all groups in single container per cell",
