  "body": "- Move Image Cell selector from Layout tab to Media tab (Background Image section)\n- Remove separate Cell Assignment section from Layout tab\n- Add new Text Alignment section that responds to structure selection:\n  - Section selected: applies alignment to all cells in that row/column\n  - Cell selected: applies alignment to just that cell\n  - Nothing selected: applies global alignment\n- Reduces from 3 grids to 1 main structure grid\n- Clearer relationship between selection and controls",
