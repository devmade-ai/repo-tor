  "body": "Implemented the following features:\n- Collapsible channel sections with toggle button\n- Initial load shows only 'calls' channel active at 100% volume\n- Automatic volume splitting between unlocked and active channels\n- Volume splitting triggers on both lock events and active status changes\n\nThe automatic volume splitting ensures percentages always add up to 100%\nby distributing available percentage equally among unlocked, active channels.",
