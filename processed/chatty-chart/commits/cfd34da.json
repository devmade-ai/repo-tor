  "subject": "Fix visualization freeze by removing CSS transition",
  "body": "The page was freezing when clicking \"Update Visualization\" buttons due to\nCSS transitions on 10,000 squares being animated simultaneously. This\noverwhelmed the browser's rendering engine.\n\nChanges:\n- Remove transition from .square class in styles.css (line 521)\n- Update claude.md to document the performance issue\n- Remove outdated animation improvement suggestion from docs\n\nThe visualization now updates instantly without freezing, providing better\nUX as users can see the new distribution immediately rather than waiting\nfor a 0.4s fade animation.",
