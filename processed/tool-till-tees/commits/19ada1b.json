  "subject": "Fix serverless function deployment by removing vercel devDep and adding build script",
  "body": "Two issues were preventing successful Vercel builds:\n\n1. `vercel` in devDependencies caused Vercel to warn \"will be\n   ignored\" and strip it before npm install, creating a mismatch\n   with the lockfile. Removed it since the Vercel CLI is provided\n   by the platform.\n\n2. No `build` script existed — if the Vercel project has a build\n   command configured (even the default `npm run build`), it would\n   fail. Added a no-op build script since serverless functions\n   don't need a build step (Vercel compiles TypeScript automatically).\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_017jorRZB6ANxXDQhyH1Xdom",
