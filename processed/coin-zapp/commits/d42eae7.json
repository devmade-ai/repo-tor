  "body": "**What Changed:**\n- Updated app.json to use coin-zapp branding (removed template references)\n- Created .env.example with correct environment variable names\n- Rewrote README.md to clearly separate implemented vs planned features\n- Updated docs/HISTORY.md with all 5 commits from git history\n- Added current status sections to docs/TODO.md and docs/Koinz_Setup_Guide.md\n- Added implementation status section to claude.md\n\n**Why:**\n- Documentation was describing the target state as if fully implemented\n- Template artifacts (expo-supabase-starter) needed to be replaced\n- Environment variable naming was inconsistent between code and docs\n- Missing .env.example file that README referenced\n- Needed clear distinction between what exists vs what's planned\n\n**Impact:**\n- Developers can now see actual project status at a glance\n- Setup instructions are accurate and won't cause confusion\n- Documentation links are corrected\n- Git history is properly documented in HISTORY.md\n\n**Files Changed:**\n- app.json: Updated branding and bundle identifiers\n- .env.example: Created with correct variable names\n- README.md: Added status section, fixed structure, corrected links\n- docs/HISTORY.md: Documented all 5 commits with context\n- docs/TODO.md: Added current status overview\n- docs/Koinz_Setup_Guide.md: Added setup progress tracker\n- claude.md: Added implementation status warnings",
