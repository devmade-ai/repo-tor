  "body": "The author-map.json config existed but wasn't being used during data aggregation. Now the aggregate script:\n\n- Loads config/author-map.json at startup\n- Resolves raw emails to canonical author IDs\n- Normalizes author_id in all commits\n- Merges contributor stats by canonical ID\n- Includes metadata.authors for dashboard resolution\n\nResult: jacotheron87's two email addresses are now properly merged into a single contributor (4 total instead of 5).",
