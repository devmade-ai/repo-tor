  "subject": "feat: add incremental processing support for \"feed the chicken\"",
  "body": "Add manifest-based tracking to enable resumable batch processing:\n- scripts/pending.js: Generates pending batches by comparing manifests\n  against extracted commits. Supports --rebuild-manifests flag.\n- scripts/manifest-update.js: Updates manifest after batch approval\n- processed/<repo>/manifest.json: Tracks processed SHAs (source of truth)\n- pending/<repo>/batches/: Generated batches of unprocessed commits only\n\nThis allows \"feed the chicken\" to work correctly even after merging\nand starting a new session - only truly new/unprocessed commits will\nbe presented for review.\n\nUpdated EXTRACTION_PLAYBOOK.md with new workflow documentation.",
