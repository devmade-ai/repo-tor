Device/Platform Attribution\n   - Split contributions by committer name (mobile vs desktop)\n   - Config mapping for name variations with device tags\n\n2. AI-Powered Commit Categorization\n   - Claude reads commit messages + diffs to understand intent\n   - Auto-tagging beyond conventional commit types\n   - Confidence scores and human override\n\n3. Multi-Tag Commit Model\n   - One commit can have multiple tags (feat + refactor + docs)\n   - Schema change from single type to tags[] with weights\n   - Backward compatibility with existing data\n\n4. Tag-Centric Reporting\n   - Shift focus from commit counts to accomplishments\n   - Effort weighting based on complexity\n   - Activity vs output distinction",
