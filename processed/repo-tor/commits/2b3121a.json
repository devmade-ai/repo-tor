  "subject": "feat: add role-based view levels (Executive/Management/Developer)",
  "body": "Add view level selector that changes data granularity for different audiences\nwhile keeping the same dashboard layout:\n\n- Executive: aggregated totals, weekly heatmap, summary-only drilldowns\n- Management: per-repo groupings, daily heatmap, summary drilldowns\n- Developer: individual contributors, hourly heatmap, full commit lists (default)\n\nImplementation includes:\n- VIEW_LEVELS config with granularity settings per level\n- Aggregation functions (aggregateContributors, aggregateForDrilldown, etc.)\n- Modified renderContributors to use aggregation layer\n- Modified detail pane to show summaries for non-developer views\n- Added renderWeeklyHeatmap and renderDailyHeatmap for different time views\n- UI selector in filter sidebar with localStorage persistence\n\nFilters still apply across all view levels. Layout remains consistent.",
