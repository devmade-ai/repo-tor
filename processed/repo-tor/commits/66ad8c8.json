  "body": "- Move filter bar above tabs (always visible)\n- Add filter indicator showing \"X of Y\" when active\n- Apply filters to all tabs (Work, Health, etc.) not just Activity\n- Update all render functions to use getFilteredCommits()\n- Preserve filter state across repo switches with validation\n\nPreviously filters only affected the commit list on the Activity tab. Now all charts, stats, and breakdowns respect the active filters.",
