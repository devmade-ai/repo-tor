  "subject": "refactor: migrate from batch files to individual commit files",
  "body": "Store each analyzed commit as a separate JSON file instead of batching 15 commits per file. This simplifies deduplication (file existence = processed), enables atomic edits, and produces cleaner git diffs.\n\nChanges:\n- Add scripts/save-commit.js for saving individual commits\n- Add scripts/migrate-batches-to-commits.js for one-time migration\n- Update scripts/aggregate-processed.js to read from commits/\n- Update scripts/extract.js to write individual commit files\n- Migrate all 4 repos (576 commits total)\n- Delete old batches/ directories\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>",
