  "body": "Both scripts now write malformed commits to needs-reprocess.json files\ninstead of silently skipping them:\n\nsave-commit.js:\n- Validates all required fields before saving\n- Valid commits are saved, invalid ones written to needs-reprocess.json\n- Exits with error if any commits failed validation\n- Clear error messages explaining what went wrong\n\naggregate-processed.js:\n- Loudly reports all malformed commits during aggregation\n- Writes them to processed/<repo>/needs-reprocess.json\n- Shows warning at end of output\n\nThis ensures validation failures are visible and actionable rather\nthan silently lost.\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01GTJnfM2q8ybazZtZ1Y54fg",
