  "body": "- Restructured stylePresets.js with per-layout settings for each Look\n- Each Look now defines specific overlay, alignment settings for every layout\n- Added activeLayoutPreset tracking to useAdState\n- Updated applyStylePreset to use getLookSettingsForLayout helper\n- Gradients now intelligently point toward text cells based on layout\n- Split layouts get minimal overlay, fullbleed layouts get stronger overlays\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01GjPKuSJZuDMoStckvT7wR5",
