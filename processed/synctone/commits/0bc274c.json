  "subject": "improve: enhance notification instructions with iOS Safari dual-layer permissions and better icon states",
  "body": "- Add iOS Safari-specific instructions covering BOTH system-level and browser-level permissions\n- Fix icon accuracy: now shows correct states for loading, granted, denied, and undetermined\n- Add granted state handler: clicking bell when enabled shows confirmation instead of re-requesting\n- Import getDeviceType for platform-aware Safari instructions\n\nAddresses user feedback:\n1. Mobile web (iOS Safari) requires checking TWO places for notifications\n2. Icon now accurately represents all permission states\n3. Instructions only show when permissions are denied (correct behavior)",
