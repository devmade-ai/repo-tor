  "subject": "Fix notification permission state detection on web reload",
  "body": "Problem:\n- After page refresh, notification bell showed as disabled (🔕) even though permissions were previously granted\n- OneSignal permission check was running before SDK was fully initialized\n- Errors during initialization incorrectly returned 'denied' status\n\nSolution:\n- Improved waitForOneSignal() to verify full initialization by testing API calls\n- Changed error fallback from 'denied' to 'undetermined' to avoid false negatives\n- Added loading state (⏳) to bell icon while checking permissions\n- Enhanced player ID retrieval with permission validation and warnings\n\nThis ensures notification status is accurately reflected after deployments and page refreshes.",
