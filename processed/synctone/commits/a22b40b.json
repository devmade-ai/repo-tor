  "body": "On web mobile, tapping a message was immediately executing an action\ninstead of showing the action sheet with options.\n\n- Remove tap gesture on web platform (keep long-press and swipe only)\n- Reduce long-press duration on web from 500ms to 300ms for better UX\n- Keep native behavior unchanged (tap, long-press, and swipe all work)\n\nThis prevents accidental triggers on web while maintaining responsive\ninteraction through long-press (300ms) or swipe gestures.",
