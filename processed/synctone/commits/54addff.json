  "subject": "enhance: fine-tune scroll behavior and gesture handling on mobile web",
  "body": "Improve mobile web UX with better gesture discrimination, visual feedback, and smoother scroll physics.\n\nChanges:\n- Implement angle-based gesture discrimination in MessageBubbleWeb using Math.atan2 to distinguish horizontal swipe (±30°) from vertical scroll (60-120°)\n- Add visual swipe feedback with translateX animation and fade-in reply icon (↩️) during swipe-to-reply gesture\n- Unify swipe threshold to single 60px value for clearer user feedback\n- Add smooth scroll CSS properties to FlatList on web (scrollBehavior: 'smooth', WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch')\n- Tune onEndReachedThreshold to 0.3 on web for earlier pagination trigger\n- Improve scroll restoration during pagination with double requestAnimationFrame and temporary scrollBehavior override to eliminate jumps\n- Update CLAUDE.md with detailed gesture handling documentation\n- Update docs/TODO.md and docs/HISTORY.md\n\nImpact: Eliminates scroll/swipe conflicts, makes swipe-to-reply discoverable with visual feedback, and creates smoother scrolling experience on mobile web that feels closer to native app quality.",
