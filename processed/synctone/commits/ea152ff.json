  "subject": "Fix whitespace text node warnings in React Native web",
  "body": "Remove newlines between sibling JSX elements within View components that were creating unwanted text nodes. In React/JSX, whitespace (including newlines) between sibling elements becomes a text node, which causes \"Unexpected text node\" warnings in React Native web since View components cannot have text node children.\n\nFixed in:\n- app/_layout.tsx: Removed newlines between ActivityIndicator/Text and between Text/Pressable elements\n- app/(app)/home.tsx: Removed newlines between Pressable elements, View elements, comments, and EmptyState component\n- components/ChatListItem.tsx: Removed newlines before inline comments between sibling View elements\n\nAll sibling elements within View components now appear on the same line or have comments attached directly to closing tags (e.g., `</Element>{/* comment */}`) to prevent whitespace text nodes.",
