  "subject": "fix: use native browser Notification API for reliable icon state",
  "body": "The previous approaches created a circular dependency between native permission\nand OneSignal SDK, causing state flashing and unreliable icon display.\n\nRoot cause: Icon showed same emoji (🔔) for both 'granted' and 'undetermined'\nstates, and the code kept switching between native and OneSignal as source of\ntruth without fixing the underlying issue.\n\nSolution:\n- Use native window.Notification.permission ONLY for UI state (icon)\n- Check synchronously (no await) for instant, accurate state on page load\n- No more 'loading' state transitions or flashing between states\n- OneSignal SDK still used for push token/subscription management\n- Don't recheck permission when SDK loads (native is already correct)\n\nThis eliminates the back-and-forth between commits b03c99f and 84d2ce5.\nNative browser permission IS the single source of truth and is always accurate\nbecause OneSignal uses the same API underneath.",
