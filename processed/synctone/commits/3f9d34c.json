  "body": "Implement granular platform detection and notification support to properly handle notifications across three distinct platforms:\n- Native mobile (iOS/Android): expo-notifications with APNs/FCM\n- Web mobile: Service Worker with Web Push API\n- Web desktop: Browser Notification API (banner hidden by default)\n\nAdd new platform detection utility (utils/platform.ts) that uses user agent, touch capability, and screen size to distinguish web mobile from web desktop.\n\nUpdate notification service with platform-specific implementations:\n- getNotificationCapabilities() returns platform-specific feature support\n- Platform-aware permission requests and token retrieval\n- Auto-register service worker for web mobile before requesting permissions\n\nEnhance notification components with platform awareness:\n- NotificationBanner shows platform-specific messaging and hides on web desktop\n- useNotifications hook returns capabilities for UI adjustments\n- Service worker improvements with skipWaiting() and clients.claim()",
