  "subject": "Fix OneSignal service worker loading on web platforms",
  "body": "- Update OneSignalSDKWorker.js to use correct SDK v16 service worker script (.sw.js instead of .page.js)\n- Add Vercel rewrite rule to exclude service worker from catch-all routing\n- Update documentation with OneSignal deployment requirements\n\nFixes \"DOMException: The operation is insecure\" error when loading OneSignal on Firefox and other browsers. The catch-all rewrite was intercepting service worker requests, causing script evaluation failures.",
