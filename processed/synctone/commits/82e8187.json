  "body": "Added 3 crucial tones that were missing from the tone system:\n- shy (Feeling) - for timid/self-conscious messages\n- embarrassed (Feeling) - for feeling exposed after mistakes\n- joking (Attitude) - clarifies \"this is meant to be funny\"\n\nRenamed sarcastic to \"(not) sarcastic\" for meta-sarcastic effect.\n\nUpdated documentation:\n- constants/tones.ts: Added new tones with appropriate colors\n- CLAUDE.md: Fixed tone counts (35→37) and corrected Feeling category (removed \"excited\" which was incorrectly listed)\n- README.md: Updated tone counts and lists to match\n\nNew totals: 17 Feeling, 12 Attitude, 8 Energy = 37 total tones",
