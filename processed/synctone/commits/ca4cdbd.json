  "subject": "feat: add distinct notification icon for undetermined permission state",
  "body": "Previously, the undetermined state (user not yet asked) showed the same icon (🔕) as the denied state (user blocked notifications), causing confusion.\n\nNow each permission state has a clear visual indicator:\n- ⏳ Loading: Checking permission status\n- 🔔 Undetermined: Not yet asked - invites user to enable\n- ✅ Granted: Notifications enabled and working\n- 🔕 Denied: Notifications blocked - tap for system settings instructions\n\nThis improves UX by clearly distinguishing between \"ready to enable\" and \"blocked\" states.",
