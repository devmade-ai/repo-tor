  "body": "- Show delete button on all web platforms (mobile and desktop)\n  - Long-press gestures don't work reliably on mobile web browsers\n  - Delete button now visible on mobile web with active:scale-95 feedback\n  - Removed isWebMobile check and isMobilePlatform import\n\n- Restore code readability by adding back blank lines\n  - Previous whitespace \"fixes\" removed blank lines between sections\n  - Made code hard to read without actually fixing warnings\n  - Blank lines between JSX elements don't create text nodes\n  - Restored formatting in: home.tsx, _layout.tsx, ChatListItem.tsx,\n    ToneSelector.tsx, MessageInfoModal.tsx\n\nThe whitespace changes were likely misguided - blank lines between JSX\nelements are just formatting and don't create text node warnings in React.\nIf warnings persist, they're likely from a different source.",
