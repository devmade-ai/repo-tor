  "body": "Each of the 37 tones now has its own unique color that's a subtle\nvariation within its category family:\n\n- Feeling: pink/coral/rose variations (happy=#FF7EB3, sad=#C490A8, etc.)\n- Attitude: teal/cyan/mint variations (playful=#5CD9D0, serious=#5BA8A8)\n- Energy: orange/gold/amber variations (calm=#E8C878, excited=#FFB060)\n\nCategory base colors preserved for header indicators via CATEGORY_COLORS.\nThis makes messages more visually interesting while maintaining cohesion.",
