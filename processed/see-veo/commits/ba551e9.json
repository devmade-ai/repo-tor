  "body": "Adds sections and rules that were dropped during the initial merge:\n- Best Practices: well-maintained libraries preference\n- Code Organization: class size thresholds (400/600 lines)\n- Decision Documentation: strengthened to \"must\", added example\n- User Experience: full section (with project note for static site)\n- Documentation: /docs structure and rules\n- Testing: guidelines (with project note for no test runner yet)\n- Paths config: DOCS_PATH, WORKING_DOCS_PATH, etc.\n- Workflow: plan path, test step, docs step\n- Prohibitions: decision context comments\n\nKeeps intentional project adaptations (Tailwind styling, dark-only theme).\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01CBwkaYuxkkviJXsqGh7AXs",
