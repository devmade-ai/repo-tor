  "body": "The interest notification API is a separate project deployed independently.\nUpdated DebugBanner diagnostic message, test comments, and CLAUDE.md to\nstop referencing the API as if it lives in this repo. Also moved the\nPortfolioCallout from before Contact to after Projects where it's more\ncontextually relevant — \"here's my work, and this site is one too.\"\n\nTags: cleanup, docs, ux\nComplexity: 2\nUrgency: 2\nImpact: user-facing\nRisk: low\nDebt: paid\nEpic: portfolio-polish\nSemver: patch\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01LBdfT4HpA5cgo1Db7Exd7c",
