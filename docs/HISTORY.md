Log of significant changes to code and documentation.

### Timeline Horizontal Bar Chart
- Changed timeline chart from vertical columns to horizontal bars
- Dates on Y-axis (newest at top), commit counts on X-axis
- Better mobile experience - more room for date labels, natural vertical scroll

### Mobile Timeline Improvements
- Improved filter bar layout with responsive grid (2-col mobile, 3-col tablet, flex desktop)
- Stacked filter labels above inputs for better touch targets
- Reduced chart height on mobile (`h-48` vs `h-64`)
- Redesigned commit list items with responsive layout:
  - Commit message wraps on mobile, truncates on desktop
  - Metadata flows with dot separators on mobile, full text on desktop
  - Line counts (+/-) show inline on desktop, below metadata on mobile

### Mobile Tab Fix
- Fixed dashboard tabs overflowing on mobile screens
- Added `overflow-x-auto` for horizontal scrolling
- Added `whitespace-nowrap` to all tab buttons
- Used negative margin (`-mx-4 px-4`) for edge-to-edge scroll area on mobile
- Added CSS class `.scrollbar-hide` to hide scrollbar while maintaining scroll functionality
- Touch scrolling enabled via `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`

### Feature Roadmap Planning

Added high-priority TODO items for next phase of development:
- **Timestamp Views & Developer Insights** - Commits by hour (0-23), commits by day of week (Mon-Sun), heatmaps, developer activity patterns, commit type trends
- **Work Pattern Visual Distinction** - Work hours (8-5) vs after-hours, weekends, SA public holidays - all visually different across ALL tabs/views
- **Filter Persistence & Cross-Tab Behavior** - Global filter state across all tabs, URL params for shareable links, localStorage for session persistence
- **Visual Design & Dark Mode** - Full dark theme with system preference detection, color palette refinement, typography improvements
- **Private Repository Security** - Sanitization mode, anonymization options, content filtering, local-only mode documentation
- **Repository Management** - Repo rename handling, alias support, migration tools, archive detection

New Research/Investigation section:
- **Device/Platform Attribution** - Split contributions by committer name (mobile vs desktop)
- **AI-Powered Commit Categorization** - Use Claude to read messages + diffs and intelligently tag
- **Multi-Tag Commit Model** - Rethink single-type assumption; one commit can have multiple tags
- **Tag-Centric Reporting** - Shift from commit counts to accomplishment-based metrics

### Direction Shift: Tag-Based Analytics

Refocused tool around three core metrics:

- **When** - Timestamp analytics (hour, day, work hours, weekends, holidays)
- **What** - AI-analyzed tags from commit messages (multiple per commit)
- **Complexity** - Score based on files changed + tag count (scale 1-5)

Created:

- `docs/EXTRACTION_PLAYBOOK.md` - AI-driven extraction process, triggered by "feed the chicken"
- Updated CLAUDE.md with trigger phrase section
- Reorganized TODO.md around new direction (removed completed items, added Foundation section)

Key decisions:

- AI analyzes each commit message (replaces regex parsing)
- Schema: `type` → `tags[]`, add `complexity` field
- User triggers, AI executes, user commits/pushes

### Dashboard Multi-Tag Support (Phase 2)

Implemented backward-compatible multi-tag support in the dashboard:

- Added `getCommitTags()` helper - uses `tags[]` if present, falls back to mapping `type` to tag
- Added TAG_COLORS and TYPE_TO_TAG mappings for new tag vocabulary
- Filter renamed from "Type" to "Tag" - matches commits with any matching tag
- Commit list shows all tags (up to 3 with "+N" overflow indicator)
- "By Type" tab renamed to "By Tag" - counts each tag occurrence
- Progress tab Feature vs Bug Fix now tag-aware (checks both old and new tag names)
- `combineDataFiles()` builds tagBreakdown alongside typeBreakdown

Dashboard is backward compatible: old data (single `type`) works, new data (`tags[]`) also works.

### Added chatty-chart Repository

- Added `illuminAI-select/chatty-chart` to tracked repositories
- Repository stats: 42 commits, 4 contributors, 9 files tracked
- Total dashboard now shows 543 commits across 4 repositories
- Updated `config/repos.json` and re-aggregated all data

### Duplicate Contributor Fix

- Created `config/author-map.json` to merge duplicate contributor entries
- Issue: jacotheron87 appeared twice due to different email addresses:
  - `jacotheron87@gmail.com` (51 commits)
  - `34473836+jacotheron87@users.noreply.github.com` (1 commit via GitHub web)
- Solution: Added author mapping to merge both emails under single identity
- Re-aggregated data with `--author-map` flag
- Contributors reduced from 4 to 3 (correct count)

### Multi-Repo Admin Setup

- Created `config/repos.json` - Central config file tracking repository URLs
  - Stores name, URL, and date added for each repo
  - Enables reproducible extraction without re-providing URLs
- Created `scripts/update-all.sh` - Automated update script
  - Reads repos from `config/repos.json`
  - Clones new repos to `.repo-cache/` (gitignored)
  - Pulls updates for existing repos
  - Runs extraction on each repo
  - Aggregates all data into `dashboard/data.json`
  - Supports `--fresh` flag to re-clone everything
- Added repos: social-ad-creator (156 commits), model-pear (302 commits)
- Updated `docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md` with managed repos workflow
- Simplified `.gitignore`: track all `reports/`, ignore `.repo-cache/`

### GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

- Fixed `data.json` not loading on live GitHub Pages site
- Issue: `deploy.yml` copied `dashboard/index.html` but not `dashboard/data.json`
- Fix: Added step to copy `dashboard/data.json` to `_site/data.json`
- Now `fetch('data.json')` resolves correctly on the deployed site

## 2026-01-18

### Dashboard Auto-Load Fix
- Copied `data.json` to `dashboard/` folder for GitHub Pages auto-load
