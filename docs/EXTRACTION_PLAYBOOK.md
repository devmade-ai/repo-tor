# Extraction Playbook

Step-by-step instructions for AI-driven data extraction and analysis.

**Persona:** `@data` (see CLAUDE.md)

## Overview

Two-stage process with persistent storage of AI-analyzed commits:

1. **Extract** raw git data (ephemeral)
2. **AI analyzes** each commit message and assigns tags, complexity, urgency, and impact
3. **Store** in `processed/` folder (persistent, source of truth)
4. **Aggregate** to dashboard (generated from processed)

## Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **"hatch the chicken"** | Full reset - delete everything, extract all repos, AI analyzes ALL commits, save to `processed/`, aggregate to dashboard |
| **"feed the chicken"** | Incremental - extract repos, AI analyzes only NEW commits (not in `processed/`), update `processed/`, re-aggregate |

## Batch Processing Strategy

Human-in-the-loop review ensures quality tagging.

### Batch Size
- Process **15 commits per batch**
- AI presents analysis, **user reviews and approves**
- After approval: write to `processed/`, update manifest
- Commits happen on demand (not after every batch)
- If session ends, uncommitted work is lost (commit regularly)

### Review Format

For each batch, AI presents commits like this:

```
[1/15] abc123
Subject: Fix button placement and performance issues
Body:
- Move "Update Visualization" button below the image
- Fix page freeze on visualization update by removing scrollIntoView
- Optimize DOM manipulation using classList.toggle
- Update help documentation to reflect UI changes

Tags: refactor, bugfix, performance, docs
Complexity: 4 | Urgency: 3 | Impact: user-facing
---
[2/15] def456
...
```

User responds:
- **"approve"** - Save batch, continue to next (no commit yet)
- **"approve and commit"** - Save batch + commit all pending changes
- **"commit"** - Commit all pending changes now
- **"#3 should be feature not refactor"** - AI corrects and re-presents
- **"stop"** - Commit pending changes and end session

### Benefits
- **Accurate**: Human review catches AI mistakes
- **Multi-tag**: AI reads full message, assigns ALL relevant tags
- **Fast**: 15 commits per batch, fewer approval prompts
- **Flexible**: Commit when you want, not after every batch

## File Structure

```
reports/                      # Raw extracted data (ephemeral)
  <repo-name>/
    commits.json              # All commits (raw, no AI tags)
    batches/                  # Split into files of 25 for AI review
      batch-001.json          # Commits 1-25
      batch-002.json          # Commits 26-50
      ...
    metadata.json
    data.json

processed/                    # AI-analyzed data (committed to git)
  <repo-name>/
    manifest.json             # Tracks processed SHAs (source of truth)
    batches/                  # Approved batches copied here
      batch-001.json          # Approved with AI tags
      batch-002.json
      ...
    metadata.json

pending/                      # Generated unprocessed commits (ephemeral)
  <repo-name>/
    batches/                  # Only commits NOT in manifest
      batch-001.json
      ...

config/
  repos.json                  # Tracked repositories
  author-map.json             # Author identity mapping

dashboard/
  data.json                   # Aggregated from processed/
```

**Progress tracking via manifest:**
- Each repo has `processed/<repo>/manifest.json` with array of processed SHAs
- Run `node scripts/pending.js` to generate pending batches
- Pending batches contain ONLY commits not in the manifest
- This works regardless of batch boundary shifts from new commits

**What's committed to git:**

- `processed/*/batches/*.json` - AI-analyzed commits (source of truth)
- `processed/*/manifest.json` - Tracks which SHAs are processed
- `dashboard/data.json` - Aggregated dashboard data

**What's gitignored (working files):**

- `reports/` - Raw extracted data (regenerated by extract)
- `pending/` - Generated pending commits (regenerated)
- `.repo-cache/` - Cloned repositories

---

## Hatch the Chicken (Full Reset)

Use when: Starting fresh, schema changes, or need to reprocess everything.

### Step 1: Clean Slate

```bash
# Delete ALL extracted and processed data
rm -rf processed/
rm -rf reports/

# Delete dashboard aggregated data
rm -f dashboard/commits.json dashboard/data.json dashboard/summary.json dashboard/metadata.json dashboard/contributors.json dashboard/files.json
```

**What gets deleted:**
- `processed/` - All AI-analyzed batches
- `reports/` - All raw extracted data and batch files
- `dashboard/*.json` - Aggregated dashboard data

**What's preserved:**
- `config/repos.json` - List of tracked repos
- `config/author-map.json` - Author identity mapping
- `dashboard/index.html` - Dashboard UI

### Step 2: Extract Each Repository

For each repo in `config/repos.json`:

```bash
# Clone/update repo
scripts/update-all.sh
```

This puts raw repo data in `.repo-cache/`.

### Step 3: AI Analyze Each Repository (Human Review)

For each repository, process batch files one at a time:

**Per batch file:**
1. Find next batch: first `batch-NNN.json` in `reports/<repo>/batches/` NOT in `processed/<repo>/batches/`
2. Read the batch file (10 commits with subject + body)
3. AI analyzes each commit and proposes:
   - Tags (multiple allowed, based on full message content)
   - Complexity score (1-5)
4. Present to user in review format (see above)
5. User approves or requests corrections
6. On approval: copy batch file to `processed/<repo>/batches/batch-NNN.json` (with AI tags added)
7. Commit: `git commit -m "chore: process <repo> batch NNN"`

**User commands:**
- `approve` - Save batch to processed/, continue to next
- `#N tag1, tag2` - Correct tags for commit N, re-present
- `stop` - End session (progress is saved)

**Repeat until all batch files processed or user stops.**

**Progress check:**
```bash
# See what's done vs pending
ls reports/<repo>/batches/   # All batches
ls processed/<repo>/batches/ # Completed batches
```

**Verification per repo:**
- [ ] Every commit has at least one tag
- [ ] Every commit has complexity 1-5
- [ ] Every commit has urgency 1-5
- [ ] Every commit has impact (internal/user-facing/infrastructure/api)
- [ ] Tags reflect FULL message content (subject + body)
- [ ] Same number of batch files in processed/ as reports/

### Step 4: Aggregate to Dashboard

Combine all `processed/` data into dashboard files:

```bash
node scripts/aggregate.js
```

### Step 5: Commit Changes

```bash
git add processed/ dashboard/
git commit -m "chore: hatch the chicken - full extraction"
git push
```

---

## Feed the Chicken (Incremental)

Use when: Adding new commits OR resuming interrupted processing.

### Step 1: Extract Fresh Data

```bash
scripts/update-all.sh
```

This extracts ALL commits from each repo into `reports/`.

### Step 2: Generate Pending Batches

```bash
node scripts/pending.js
```

This script:
1. Reads `processed/<repo>/manifest.json` to get already-processed SHAs
2. Compares against freshly extracted commits in `reports/`
3. Generates `pending/<repo>/batches/` with ONLY unprocessed commits

**Output shows:**
```
social-ad-creator: 66/156 pending (7 batches)
model-pear: 302/302 pending (31 batches)
Total: 368 pending commits in 38 batches
```

### Step 3: AI Analyze Pending Batches (Human Review)

Process pending batch files one at a time:

**Per batch file:**
1. Read from `pending/<repo>/batches/batch-NNN.json`
2. AI proposes tags + complexity + urgency + impact for each commit
3. Present to user for review
4. User approves or corrects
5. On approval, AI runs save script (fast, no IDE dialogs):
   ```bash
   cat <<'EOF' | node scripts/save-batch.js <repo>
   {"commits": [...analyzed commits...]}
   EOF
   ```
6. Script saves batch + updates manifest in one step
7. Commit changes

**User commands:**
- `approve` - Save batch via script, continue to next
- `#N tag1, tag2` - Correct tags for commit N, re-present
- `stop` - End session (progress saved via manifest)

**Why script-based saves?**
Using `save-batch.js` instead of Write tool calls avoids IDE approval dialogs for each file, which slows down significantly as sessions get longer.

**Stop when:**
- All pending batches processed, OR
- User says "stop" (progress saved in manifest)

**When a repo is fully processed (no more pending batches):**
AI automatically runs cleanup for that repo:
```bash
# Clean up redundant files for completed repo
rm -f reports/<repo>/commits.json reports/<repo>/data.json
rm -f reports/<repo>/files.json reports/<repo>/contributors.json reports/<repo>/summary.json
rm -rf pending/<repo>/
```

### Step 4: Re-aggregate to Dashboard

```bash
node scripts/aggregate.js
```

### Step 5: Commit Changes

```bash
git add processed/ dashboard/
git commit -m "chore: feed the chicken - X new commits"
git push
```

### Key Differences from "Hatch"

| Aspect | Hatch the Chicken | Feed the Chicken |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Starting point | Delete everything | Keep existing processed/ |
| Batch source | `reports/` batches | `pending/` batches |
| Tracks progress | Batch file existence | manifest.json SHAs |
| Handles new commits | N/A (full reset) | Only processes new ones |
| Resume after merge | Start over | Continues seamlessly |

### Complexity Score (1-5)

Based on scope and impact of changes:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Trivial - single file, minor change |
| 2 | Small - few files, straightforward change |
| 3 | Medium - multiple files, moderate complexity |
| 4 | Large - many files, significant changes |
| 5 | Major - extensive changes, high complexity |

### Urgency Score (1-5)

Based on how critical the change was — reactive vs proactive work:

| Score | Level | Description | Signals |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Planned** | Scheduled work, no time pressure | Feature roadmap, refactoring, tech debt cleanup |
| 2 | **Normal** | Regular development pace | Standard bug fixes, improvements, maintenance |
| 3 | **Elevated** | Needs attention soon | Bug affecting some users, approaching deadline |
| 4 | **Urgent** | High priority, blocking work | Breaking functionality, blocking other devs |
| 5 | **Critical** | Drop everything | Production down, security vulnerability, hotfix |

**Indicators to look for:**
- Keywords: "urgent", "hotfix", "critical", "ASAP", "emergency", "breaking"
- Tags: `hotfix`, `vulnerability`, `security` suggest higher urgency
- Time context: Weekend/after-hours commits may indicate urgency
- Severity words: "crash", "down", "broken", "blocking"

**Default:** Most commits are urgency 2 (normal development pace)

### Impact Category

Based on who/what is affected by the change:

| Impact | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `internal` | Only affects developers, no user impact | Tests, refactoring, docs, tooling, CI/CD, code comments |
| `user-facing` | Directly affects end users | UI changes, features, bug fixes users experience, UX |
| `infrastructure` | Affects deployment, hosting, operations | CI/CD, Docker, monitoring, hosting config, env vars |
| `api` | Affects external integrations or contracts | API endpoints, breaking changes, webhooks |

**Guidelines:**
- A commit can only have ONE impact category (choose the primary)
- If a commit touches both user-facing and internal (e.g., feature + tests), choose `user-facing`
- `merge` commits are typically `internal` unless the PR description indicates otherwise
- Documentation about user features is `user-facing`; dev docs are `internal`

### Examples

| Commit Subject | Tags | Complexity | Urgency | Impact |
|----------------|------|------------|---------|--------|
| "Add dark mode toggle" | `feature`, `ui` | 2 | 1 | user-facing |
| "Fix crash on startup" | `bugfix` | 2 | 4 | user-facing |
| "Fix XSS vulnerability in login" | `bugfix`, `vulnerability`, `sanitization` | 3 | 5 | user-facing |
| "Refactor auth module" | `refactor`, `types` | 3 | 1 | internal |
| "Update session notes" | `docs` | 1 | 2 | internal |
| "Add comments explaining auth flow" | `comments` | 1 | 1 | internal |
| "Merge pull request #42" | `merge` | 1 | 2 | internal |
| "Upgrade React to v19" | `dependency-update`, `migration` | 4 | 2 | internal |
| "Add user API endpoint" | `feature`, `endpoint`, `api` | 3 | 2 | api |
| "Optimize image loading" | `performance`, `ux` | 2 | 2 | user-facing |
| "HOTFIX: Production DB timeout" | `hotfix`, `database`, `performance` | 2 | 5 | infrastructure |
| "Add GitHub Actions workflow" | `ci` | 2 | 1 | infrastructure |
