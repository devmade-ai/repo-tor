# Session Notes

Current state for AI assistants to continue work.

## Current State

**Dashboard V2:** Implementation complete with role-based view levels, light/dark theme, and PWA support.

**Recent Updates (2026-04-05):**

### X-Frame-Options fix for embeds
- Removed `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` from vercel.json — it blocked cross-origin iframe embeds
- Root cause: H4 audit fix applied the header globally; dashboard is public/read-only with no auth, so clickjacking protection is unnecessary
- No changes needed in see-veo or other embedding apps — existing `?embed=` URLs work as before

### SW navigation fallback bypass for embeds (2026-04-06)
- Added `navigateFallbackDenylist: [/[?&]embed=/]` to Workbox config in vite.config.js
- Root cause: The PWA service worker precaches index.html with response headers. If the SW was installed when X-Frame-Options was still present, it served stale cached responses with the old header — blocking cross-origin iframes even after the header was removed from vercel.json. The iframe blocks before JS runs, so the SW never updates — a deadlock.
- Fix: Embed URL navigations now bypass the SW entirely and go directly to the network (Vercel), always getting current headers

**Previous Updates (2026-04-02):**

### Cross-project alignment with glow-props (24 items)
- CLAUDE.md text fixes, implementations extracted to `docs/implementations/` (8 files)

### Full 9-trigger audit sweep (41 findings fixed)

- **Bugs:** Removed dark class override in main.jsx, per-file month error handling, 30s fetch timeout
- **Accessibility:** Backdrop overlays changed from aria-hidden to role="presentation", filter button touch targets increased, safe area insets for iOS
- **Debug:** ErrorBoundary routes to debug pill, SW errors to pill, network status in diagnostics, loading timeout increased to 20s
- **Performance:** Tag style cache, React.memo on HealthBars, work hours dedup in useHealthData
- **Docs:** TESTING_GUIDE updated (removed nonexistent features), USER_GUIDE theme section, CLAUDE.md dark mode status, QuickGuide Projects tab added
- **All components** (Header, TabBar, FilterSidebar, DetailPane, SettingsPane) wrapped in ErrorBoundary

**Build:** Passes (`npm run build`).

**Remaining work:** See `docs/TODO.md` — 2 backlog items (library build testing, device attribution research).
